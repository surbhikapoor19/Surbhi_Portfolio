## Project 1: [Assessing Underserved Regions (using ML) - NYC Transit System](https://github.com/We-Gold/ds-501-cs4-public)
In this project, we identified areas in New York City (NYC) that are underrepresented in transit accessibility. We wanted to understand areas of opportunity (defined as currently underserved areas where we predict people would have high public transportation usage) where the MTA could create a transit station that we believe will receive a lot of foot traffic and ticket sales.

To solve this problem, we determined the average distance to a transit station from areas all over NYC. We then determined if the area is worth investing in (would a transit station here be profitable?) by looking at predicted ridership. Each subway ride in NYC earns $2.90 per ride per person (https://www.mta.info/fares-tolls/subway-bus), and since we can predict weekly ridership, we will predict weekly revenue based on that predicted ridership.

Our data science approach will not only enable us to identify underserved areas but also to predict ridership for these areas. The resulting decision-making platform will enable the MTA to more readily evaluate potential locations for transit stops/stations rather than having to manually sort through all options.
