# Surbhi Kapoor

## Overview
I am a Data Scientist currently pursuing my Masters in Data Science with 6+ years of industry experience. I specialize in building NLP and ML systems end to end, including data preparation, model design, deployment, monitoring, and communicating results to product and business teams.

I am currently enjoying being in an academic environment where I get to research and experiment deeply. I enjoy tackling problems creatively and building solutions that are both effective and efficient.

## Research Projects

### Mental Health Risk Prediction (NHIS)
<div class="project-card">
<a href="https://github.com/surbhikapoor19/nhis_mental_health_survey" target="_blank">Project Repository</a>
</div>

**Goal:** Predict psychological distress risk using demographic and behavioral survey data.  
**Dataset:** 32,629 adult participants, 630 variables (CDC NHIS dataset)

**Approach**
- Parsed coded variables into interpretable features
- Conducted exploratory data analysis to identify risk patterns
- Trained Random Forest models for binary and multi-class severity prediction

**Results**
- Achieved 85–90 percent accuracy
- Identified interpretable risk factors that enable early screening

**Impact:** Demonstrates that early mental health screening can be done using accessible data sources.
